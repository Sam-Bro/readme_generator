> dynamically generate a readme from a users input 

a command line application that retrieves a users input to dynamically generate a README file

This project was built because rewriting README files for each project is a waste of time. The README generator helps solve the problem of the issue of rewriting a README file for every project. In the duration of this project, I learned a lot about npm packages, how to use node and more about git.
