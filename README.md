> dynamically generate a readme from a users input 

the application will be invoked with the command "node index.js". The user will be prompted for their name, project description and other information pertaining to the project the README is for . This project was built because as a developer I will need to write a lot of README files, this application will greatly simplify writing these files. The README generator helps solve the problem of rewriting a new README file for every project. In the duration of this project, I learned how to use node and inquirer to print text and user input to a new file.
